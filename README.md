# Gnau
This is a type of card game played in Malaysia called Gnau. More information is available in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnau).

I developed this game after taking [CSE 143X](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143x/20au/) at Unversity of Washington in Autumn 2020. It includes algorithms to randomly assign cards to players and determine who wins the game.
